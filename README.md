# Disk usage tree

DU-Tree is a simple command line utility which displays disk usage within a tree like structure.  This acts as a personal hello world application for any new applications.  Each folder within this repo is another language used to make du-tree.

## Usage:

`du-tree [-Vvlbf] directory`

### Arugments:

Short | Long | Explination
--- | --- | --- |
-V | --version | Show the version string.
-v | --verbose | Show as much info as possible
-l | --legend | When color is being used, show what color means what usage
-b | --bleach | No color is outputed
-f | --full | Print to full path for every file.

## Tests

The goal would be to have a unified testing suite, but that is still being looked into.
